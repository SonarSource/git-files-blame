# git-files-blame
A git command implemented with JGit that blames multiple files simultaneously.

## Usage


```java
BlameResult result = new RepositoryBlameCommand(repo) //JGit repository to be used for the blame
  .setFilePaths(List.of("fileA.java", "fileB.java")) //list of files to blame, all files of repository if not specified 
  .setMultithreading(true)
  .setStartCommit(commitId) //JGit commit id from where the blame will start, HEAD if not specified
  .call();
```

## Our idea

Currently, the git blame command is only applicable to a single file: We specify the file path to be blamed, and git returns the blame result for this single file by traversing the history of commits.  
In the event where we want to blame multiple files, we would need to call this command many times. Even though this operation can be parallelized, it has been proven to be slow on large volume of files: For each file, the original blame algorithm traverse all the commits from newest to oldest until the file is fully blamed.

Our tool propose to blame every file simultaneously, traversing the commit graph only once and saving the cost of operations that are normally done for each file.

Be aware that this forum is a community, so the standard pleasantries ("Hi", "Thanks", ...) are expected. And if you don't get an answer to your thread, you should sit on your hands for at least three days before bumping it. Operators are not standing by. ðŸ˜„
